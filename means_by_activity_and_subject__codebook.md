Codebook for the data file means_by_activity_and_subject__codebook.txt

File description:
There are 30 test subjects, each performing 6 different activities.
Thus there are 6*30=180 rows in the data file, one for each unique (subject, activity) pair.
There is also a header row containing the column names.
The columns are each separated by a single space.


These two columns uniquely identify each row:
subject: integer value indicating the test subject
activity: name of the activity being measured

The remaining columns are average values calculated for the row's subject and activity:
